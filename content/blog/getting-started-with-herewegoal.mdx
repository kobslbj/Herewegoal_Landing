## Why I Created Herewegoal

Hi everyone, I'm a 22-year-old student from Taiwan. During my time at university, I developed a strong passion for software development and worked on many side projects. I've always wanted to use my software development skills to help society. This led me to join the Jamie Gap Year Program in 2025, focusing specifically on building Herewegoal.

### Why Start a Project Like Herewegoal?

When I interned during university, I got to use different company project management platforms like Jira, Trello, and ClickUp. Naturally, I wanted to use these tools to manage my own side projects, club activities, and schoolwork. But I found them to be too much for just one person.

This gave me the idea to create my own project management platform specifically for freelancers. I wanted a simple "one-to-many" design where users could easily give or share tasks. A main feature I wanted was to let people who receive a task work together without needing to know Herewegoal or even sign up – kind of like how you can share Google Docs publicly or privately. This makes it much easier for others to join in.

So, six months ago, I started my first software company project: Herewegoal.

### Let's Talk About the Name - Herewegoal

As a Taiwanese, a fun name or "sound-alike pun" is pretty common! The name "Herewegoal" mixes things up. "Here we go" feels exciting and gives you that "just do it" energy. By putting it with "goal," I hope people can use this platform to clearly see and reach their goals!

### Finally, I Want to Share What Herewegoal is All About:

- **Clear, Simple, Easy to Use:** Made for one person working, not big teams.
- **Ready to Go, No Setup Needed:** Start using it right away without any complex steps.

My hope is that Herewegoal can help people like me – freelancers, solo workers, and even students – better manage their projects and tasks. I also really want you to give me feedback as you use Herewegoal; your thoughts are super helpful in making Herewegoal better!
