              Tools like Notion, Todoist, and Trello each solve part of the problem, but often come with trade-offs:

              <li>
                <strong>Todoist</strong> supports projects and team collaboration, but itâ€™s primarily built for managing
                personal task lists. It lacks built-in timeline views, and essential features due datesrequire a paid
                plan. To collaborate, users must sign up and join your workspace â€” which adds friction when working with
                clients, classmates, or external partners.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Notion</strong> is highly flexible, but often requires users to build their own task or project
                system from scratch. For many, it becomes overwhelming instead of productive.
